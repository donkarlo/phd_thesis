\chapter{Mission}


\paragraph{Main mission}
    the main mission to provide a model for language is to be able to compose different components of a language to reach newer horizens meaning. Some thing that human languge couldnt reach in meaning

The mission at first stage is to propose an integrated architecture of memory
\begin{itemize}
    \item storage
    \item remember
    \item leveling (from raw )
    \item review: the process building more inner clusters (both inward and outward) and
\end{itemize}
so that it together with a time serie prediction solution it can capture the highest continous anomaly when a new experience appears in the world of the experience(s) the the robot knows.
        
        
        \begin{itemize}
            \item trying the best minimiza anomaly with language structures
        \end{itemize}
        
\paragraph{Natural Language reduces free energy in MRS}
        Does existance of a composite langague where morphems are the leaves help to reduce suprise factor in free energy ?
        
        
\paragraph{Does natural language help with improving self awarene of a single robot in an MRS?}
