        \textbf{GPS} is considered an exteroceptive sensor because it provides information about an entity’s position based on external references—satellites in Earth's orbit. Even if you "close your eyes" and perceive your position internally through a GPS-like mechanism in your brain, the fundamental source of that information still comes from outside of you.
